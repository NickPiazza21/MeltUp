# MeltUp
https://crimsontoast.itch.io/meltup

A 3D, platformer game made for the UCF GDK Summer Game Jam 2024. Collaborated with UCF students to make a game in 48 hours that followed the theme: It's getting hot in here. 
You play as an ice cube that is trying to get back to its original ice cooler before it melts from being in the hot sun.
I learned about Unreal Engine 5's GUI and how to use Unreal Engine's visual blueprint system.

*BUGS:*
- The mouse does not show up in the start menu, so you will have to use the tab and enter button to navigate and click the buttons, respectively.
